# Make an Agent Return a Typed Classification

## Problem/Feature Description

A developer has a working Koog 1.0 agent that classifies GitHub issues — currently it returns a free-form string and downstream code parses it with regex (brittle). They want the agent to return a typed object directly:

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class IssueClassification(
    val type: String,        // "bug" | "feature" | "question"
    val confidence: Double,
    val suggestedLabels: List<String>,
)
```

The agent currently uses the default strategy. They want the smallest change that gets them the typed result.

## Output Specification

Produce the full updated `Main.kt` (the agent construction with the typed output and imports) and the `build.gradle.kts` dependency changes. Write each file to disk, clearly labeled with its path.
