  Author a custom graph strategy for a Koog 1.0 agent — pick the right node types,
  chain tool execution correctly, build edges with the infix vocabulary, and reach for
  subgraphs (`subgraphWithTask`, `subgraphWithVerification`) when steps deserve isolation.
  Use when the user asks to "write a custom strategy", "build a graph for the agent",
  "author a strategy DSL", "add a verify-and-fix loop", "use subgraphs", or describes
  multi-step orchestration that won't fit inside `singleRunStrategy()`.

# Author Strategy Skill

Process steps in order. Do not skip ahead.

## Step 1 — Pick Input/Output Types

Ask the user, one question at a time:

- What's the strategy's input type? `String` (default for chat-shaped agents), `Message.User` (when you control the message shape upstream), or a typed app object?
- What's the output type? `String` is the common default; typed outputs require matching node types

Proceed immediately to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Sketch the Topology Before Writing Code

Before opening the editor, write the topology as a numbered list:

- Each step: what it does, what type it produces
- Each branch: predicate, target
- Each loop: back-edge condition

If you can't name every step and edge in plain English, you don't yet know the strategy — go back and clarify with the user. The DSL captures the topology; if the topology is fuzzy, the DSL output will be too.

Proceed immediately to Step 3.

## Step 3 — Choose Node Variants by Input Type

**This is the most common source of bugs.** Match the node family to its expected input:

- **String-input nodes** (use at the top of a strategy, or after another node returns `String`):
  - `nodeLLMRequest()` — call the LLM with the current message as a user turn
  - `nodeLLMRequestOnlyCallingTools()` — like above but the LLM cannot reply with text, only tool calls
  - `nodeLLMRequestWithoutTools()` — text-only reply
  - `nodeLLMRequestForceOneTool(tool)` — force a specific tool call (covered in `use-llm-node-variants`)
  - `nodeLLMRequestStructured()` — typed JSON output (covered in `add-structured-output`)
  - `nodeLLMRequestMultipleChoices()` / `nodeLLMRequestStreaming()` — covered in `use-llm-node-variants`
  - `nodeLLMModerateText()` — content moderation

- **`Message.User`-input nodes** (use mid-graph where the previous node produced a `Message.User`):
  - `nodeLLMSendMessage()` / variants
  - `nodeLLMSendToolResults()` / variants — pair with `nodeExecuteTools`
  - `nodeLLMModerateMessage()`

Picking the wrong family produces compile-time type errors that read like generic DSL noise. The fix is almost always swapping `Request` for `SendMessage` or vice versa.

Proceed immediately to Step 4.

## Step 4 — Chain `nodeExecuteTools` Explicitly

In 1.0, `nodeExecuteTools()` returns `ReceivedToolResults` directly — the auto-writeback variant from earlier versions is gone. Always:

```kotlin
val nodeCallLLM by nodeLLMRequest()
val nodeExecuteTool by nodeExecuteTools()
val nodeSendToolResult by nodeLLMSendToolResults()

edge(nodeStart forwardTo nodeCallLLM)
edge(nodeCallLLM forwardTo nodeExecuteTool onToolCalls { true })
edge(nodeCallLLM forwardTo nodeFinish onTextMessage { true })
edge(nodeExecuteTool forwardTo nodeSendToolResult)
edge(nodeSendToolResult forwardTo nodeExecuteTool onToolCalls { true })
edge(nodeSendToolResult forwardTo nodeFinish onTextMessage { true })
```

Without the `nodeExecuteTool forwardTo nodeSendToolResult` edge, tool outputs never reach the LLM and the agent silently loses memory of what it ran.

Proceed immediately to Step 5.

## Step 5 — Build Edges with the Infix Vocabulary

Edges declare topology and branching. Vocabulary:

- `edge(a forwardTo b)` — unconditional
- `edge(a forwardTo b onToolCalls { predicate(it) })` — when the LLM produced tool calls
- `edge(a forwardTo b onTextMessage { predicate(it) })` — when the LLM produced a text reply
- `edge(a forwardTo b onCondition { boolean predicate(it) })` — arbitrary predicate
- `edge(a forwardTo b onIsInstance SomeClass::class)` — type-discriminated branching
- `edge(a forwardTo b transformed { reshape(it) })` — change shape between nodes
- `a then b` — shorthand for an unconditional sequential edge

**Member vs extension — which imports you need.** The infix vocabulary splits across two shapes; getting it wrong is the most common copy-paste compile failure.

| Primitive | Kind | Import needed? |
|---|---|---|
| `forwardTo` | infix member on `AIAgentNodeBase` | No |
| `onCondition` | infix member on `AIAgentEdgeBuilderIntermediate` | No |
| `transformed` | infix member on `AIAgentEdgeBuilderIntermediate` | No |
| `onToolCalls` | top-level extension | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.onToolCalls` |
| `onTextMessage` | top-level extension | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.onTextMessage` |
| `onIsInstance` | top-level extension | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.onIsInstance` |
| `onMessageParts` | top-level extension | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.onMessageParts` |
| `onSuccessful` / `onFailure` | top-level extensions | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.onSuccessful` / `onFailure` |
| `asUserMessage` / `asToolResultMessage` | top-level extensions | `import ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.asUserMessage` / `asToolResultMessage` |

Members travel with their receiver type and need no import. Extensions live in `ai.koog.agents.core.dsl.extension.*` and must be imported by name. Star-imports work but obscure which DSL surface is actually in use.

Branching logic belongs in edge predicates, not inside node bodies. Lifting it to edges keeps the topology inspectable.

Proceed immediately to Step 6.

## Step 6 — Lift Steps into Subgraphs

If a step needs several LLM calls, its own tool subset, or its own model, lift it into a subgraph. Reference: `examples/simple-examples/.../subgraphwithtask/CustomStrategy.kt`.

```kotlin
import ai.koog.agents.ext.agent.subgraphWithTask
import ai.koog.agents.ext.agent.subgraphWithVerification
import ai.koog.agents.ext.agent.CriticResult

val generate by subgraphWithTask<Unit, String>(generateTools, llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o) { input ->
    "system prompt for the generation step..."
}

val verify by subgraphWithVerification(tools = verifyTools, parallelTools = false) { input: String ->
    "system prompt for verifying the generated result..."
}

val fix by subgraphWithTask<CriticResult<String>, String>(tools = fixTools, llmModel = AnthropicModels.Opus_4_6) { vr ->
    "system prompt that incorporates ${vr.feedback}..."
}

edge(verify forwardTo fix onCondition { !it.successful })
edge(verify forwardTo nodeFinish onCondition { it.successful } transformed { "Project is correct." })
edge(fix forwardTo verify)
```

The generate → verify → fix shape is the canonical "real agentic workflow" demo — it shows iterative correction without inventing a planner.

`subgraphWithTask`, `subgraphWithVerification`, and `CriticResult` live in package `ai.koog.agents.ext.agent` but ship inside the **`agents-core`** artifact, which the `koog-agents` umbrella already pulls. No extra dependency needed — the standalone `ai.koog:agents-ext` artifact is a separate `1.0.0-beta` module and is NOT required for these APIs.

If you type-annotate the returned strategy, the strategy type lives in `ai.koog.agents.core.agent.entity.AIAgentGraphStrategy` (not bare `ai.koog.agents.core.agent`).

Proceed immediately to Step 7.

## Step 7 — Name Nodes by Behavior

`val classify by nodeLLMRequest()` reads as `edge(classify forwardTo ...)`. Names like `node1`, `step1`, `llm` erase what the strategy is doing.

Proceed immediately to Step 8.

## Step 8 — Hand Off

- Pass the strategy into `AIAgent(strategy = myStrategy("name"), ...)`. If the strategy isn't `singleRunStrategy` (the default), the `strategy =` parameter must be named explicitly
- Run `./gradlew build` to confirm it compiles. The most common failure is a node-type mismatch — go back to Step 3
- If the strategy needs runtime-decided ordering rather than compile-time topology, this is the wrong primitive — invoke `Skill(skill: "use-planner")` instead

Finish here.
